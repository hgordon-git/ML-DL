# ML-DL


This repository contains Machine Learning and Deep Learning Programs created for various projects. Throughout the year, the DL projects are in the process of being added as the course is in progress, and a handful of ML projects were added to show work.


The Final Project was an image classification project for pennies where we attempted to analyze whether pennies were before or after 1963, as pennies before 1963 have higher value for collectors. Some of these pennies can even yield a 1,000% return on investment as they can be worth multiple dollars, and even some can go for hundreds of dollars in value. We did run into some problems, however. First our experimental data was tested an yielded extremely low accuracy, despite cross validation tehcniques that were used to validate our training data. However, this discrepancy seems to be due to the fact that the test data was darker in color than our training data. Although unfortunate, it was a great learning experience for ML applications. 

The Lab 2 File attempts to run a linear regression model against heatrate vs. pushups. It was our first ML project that my partner, Derek Halliwell and I did. 

The Lab 4 file is another machine learning project. This is a classification problem that attempts to predict temperature based on the various predictors: we used iterations of operations, the algorithm type, and cooldown time as predictors for the response variable of temperature.
